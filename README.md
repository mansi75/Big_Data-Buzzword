# Big Data
Big data is a combination of structured, semistructured and unstructured data, more complex data sets, especially from new data sources collected by organizations that can be mined for information and used in machine learning projects, predictive modeling and other advanced analytics applications, these massive volumes of data can be used to address business problems you wouldn’t have been able to tackle before.

## The three Vs of Big Data

### Volume
Within the Social Media space for example, Volume refers to the amount of data generated through websites, portals and online applications. With big data, you’ll have to process high volumes of low-density, unstructured data. Like Facebook, twitter, instagram, Youtube they have millions of users and some even have billions of users. Every day, these users contribute to billions of images, posts, videos, tweets etc. There is a huge amount of data generated every day. This can be data of unknown value, such as Twitter data feeds, clickstreams on a webpage or a mobile app, or sensor-enabled equipment. This might be tens of terabytes of data. For others, it may be hundreds of petabytes.

### Velocity
Velocity is the fast rate at which data is generated or received and acted on. For example, every day 900 million photos are uploaded on Facebook, 500 million tweets are posted on Twitter, 0.4 million hours of video are uploaded on Youtube and 3.5 billion searches are performed in Google, this is insane amount of data. Big Data helps the company to hold this huge amount of data, accept the incoming flow of data and at the same time process it fast so that it does not create bottlenecks.

### Variety
Variety in Big Data refers to all the structured and unstructured data that has the possibility of getting generated either by humans or by machines. Traditional data types were structured and fit neatly in a relational database. With the rise of big data, data comes in new unstructured data types. Unstructured data like emails, voicemails, hand-written text, ECG reading, audio recordings etc, are also important elements under Variety, these require additional preprocessing to derive meaning and support metadata.

### The need of big data
Hude data are generated everyday containing nuggets of valuable insight, critical for business success. The challenge is how to analyse and process these data in order to derive those nuggets of information set to strengthen business strategy, efficiency and performance -be it customer feedback, market trends, demand for a product or competitor activity. Big Data solutions help companies make sense out of random information, become proactive and start setting the pace instead of continuously putting out fires and following competition.

### Big Data Analytics 
The analytics involves the use of advanced techniques and tools of analytics on the data obtained from different sources in different sizes. Big data has the properties of high variety, volume, and velocity. The data sets come from various online networks, web pages, audio and video devices, social media, logs and many other sources.
Big Data analytics involves the use of analytics techniques like machine learning, data mining, natural language processing, and statistics. The data is extracted, prepared and blended to provide analysis for the businesses. Large enterprises and multinational organizations use these techniques widely these days in different ways. There are special analytics tools that use these techniques to analyze the data sources for fresh insights. The data is usually real-time data produced at a huge scale. This data is unstructured, and the tools help to capture this data and store it for analysis. Hence the big data and business analytics tools are very advanced.

### Use of Big Data

#### Product development 
Companies like Netflix and Procter & Gamble use big data to anticipate customer demand. They build predictive models for new products and services by classifying key attributes of past and current products or services and modeling the relationship between those attributes and the commercial success of the offerings. 

#### Predictive maintenance 	
Factors that can predict mechanical failures may be deeply buried in structured data, such as the year, make, and model of equipment, as well as in unstructured data that covers millions of log entries, sensor data, error messages, and engine temperature. By analyzing these indications of potential issues before the problems happen, organizations can deploy maintenance more cost effectively and maximize parts and equipment uptime.

#### Customer experience 
A clearer view of customer experience is more possible now than ever before. Big data enables you to gather data from social media, web visits, call logs, and other sources to improve the interaction experience and maximize the value delivered. 

#### Fraud and compliance 
Security landscapes and compliance requirements are constantly evolving. Big data helps you identify patterns in data that indicate fraud and aggregate large volumes of information to make regulatory reporting much faster.

#### Machine learning 
Machine learning is a hot topic right now. And data—specifically big data—is one of the reasons why. We are now able to teach machines instead of program them. The availability of big data to train machine learning models makes that possible.

#### Operational efficiency 
With big data, you can analyze and assess production, customer feedback and returns, and other factors to reduce outages and anticipate future demands. Big data can also be used to improve decision-making in line with current market demand.

### Working of big data

*Integrate - During integration, you need to bring in the data, process it, and make sure it’s formatted and available in a form that your business analysts can get started with.

*Manage - Big data requires storage. Your storage solution can be in the cloud, on premises, or both. You can store your data in any form you want and bring your desired processing requirements and necessary process engines to those data sets on an on-demand basis. Many people choose their storage solution according to where their data is currently residing. The cloud is gradually gaining popularity because it supports your current compute requirements and enables you to spin up resources as needed.

*Analyze - Your investment in big data pays off when you analyze and act on your data. Get new clarity with a visual analysis of your varied data sets. Explore the data further to make new discoveries. Share your findings with others. Build data models with machine learning and artificial intelligence.
